# Locked In – Account Deletion & Data Removal

**Last updated:** November 27, 2025

You can delete your Locked In account at any time. Once deletion is complete, all personally identifiable data (progress history, journal entries, photos, and habit data) is permanently removed from our production systems within 30 days unless a longer retention period is required by law.

---

## Delete Your Account In-App

1. Open the Locked In iOS app.
2. Tap **Profile** → **Account & Privacy** → **Delete Account**.
3. Confirm your decision inside the system prompt.

You will receive an email confirmation immediately after the request is queued. If you signed in with Apple, Google, or another SSO provider, deletion still works the same way.

## Request Deletion or Data Export via Email

If you cannot access the app or prefer email:

- Send a message from your registered email address to **privacy@thegreatlockinapp.com** with the subject line “Delete My Locked In Account.”
- Include the email or Apple ID you used for the app plus any optional export requests (e.g., “Send me a copy of my data before deleting”).

We will acknowledge the request within 2 business days, provide a portable export (JSON/CSV) upon request, and finalize deletion within 30 days.

## What Gets Deleted

- Profile information (name, email, avatar)
- Habit programs, daily check-ins, streaks, and measurements
- Journal entries, reflections, and uploads
- Notification preferences and device tokens

We retain only the minimal logs necessary to meet legal, fraud-prevention, and security obligations.

## Need Help?

If the in-app flow fails or you do not hear back after 2 business days, please email **support@thegreatlockinapp.com** so we can resolve the issue right away.

By submitting a deletion request, you understand the process is irreversible once completed.
